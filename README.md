## 🚀 Quick Start

Follow these steps to get the DesignSystemMobile project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

-   **Flutter SDK**: [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) (version 3.x.x or higher recommended)
    -   Verify installation: `flutter --version`
-   **IDE**: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with Flutter extension, or [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) with Flutter/Dart plugins.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OsvaldoTorre/DesingSystemMobile.git
    cd DesingSystemMobile
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**
    Navigate to the project root and run `flutter pub get` to fetch all necessary Dart packages.
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3.  **Run the development server (Showcase Application)**
    This command will launch the showcase application on a connected device or emulator. If multiple devices are connected, you might need to specify one using `-d <device_id>`.

    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```
    To run on a specific platform:
    ```bash
    # For Android
    flutter run -d android

    # For iOS (requires Xcode and a connected device/simulator)
    flutter run -d ios

    # For Web
    flutter run -d chrome
    # Or to build for web: flutter build web && cd build/web && npx serve

    # For Desktop (requires desktop development setup)
    # macOS: flutter run -d macos
    # Windows: flutter run -d windows
    # Linux: flutter run -d linux
    ```

| `flutter run`               | Runs the application on a connected device/emulator.   |
| `flutter test`              | Runs all unit and widget tests.                        |
| `flutter analyze`           | Analyzes the Dart code for errors and warnings.        |
| `flutter format .`          | Formats all Dart files in the project.                 |
| `flutter build <platform>`  | Builds the application for a specific platform (e.g., `apk`, `ios`, `web`). |

### Development Workflow

1.  Clone the repository and install dependencies as described in the [Quick Start](#🚀-quick-start) section.
2.  Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., VS Code or Android Studio).
3.  Ensure you have a device or emulator running.
4.  Run `flutter run` to launch the showcase application.
5.  Make changes to the Dart files within the `lib/` directory. Flutter's hot reload feature will instantly reflect your changes without restarting the app.

## 🧪 Testing

The project uses Flutter's built-in testing framework for unit and widget tests.

To run all tests:
```bash
flutter test
```

## 🚀 Deployment

To build the application for deployment on various platforms:

### Production Build

```bash
# Build for Android (APK)
flutter build apk

# Build for iOS (requires Xcode)
flutter build ios

# Build for Web
flutter build web

# Build for Desktop (requires specific platform tooling)
flutter build macos
flutter build windows
flutter build linux
```

The build outputs will be located in the `build/` directory for each respective platform.
